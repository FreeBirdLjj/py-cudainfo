# py-cudainfo

A python script to get the cuda information of the current GPU(s).

## Preparation

Make sure that python3 is already installed, and `/usr/bin/env` can find the interpreter.

It also requires:

* nVidia GPU driver
* CUDA runtime (which means, if you're using bumblebee, please run with `optirun`)
* pycuda

## Usage

Just download the `cudainfo.py` and give it the excution permission and run it in terminal.
